How to handle multiple github accounts?

One of my work account was using signing key and email, name
For my personal github account i use ssh key for accessing repo

How to switch between work and personal repositories?

I have added the accounts using 
- ssh  key generation
- adding public key to github profile
- Adding private key file to the git configuration in ~/.ssh/config

--Sample--
Host ruudhaya
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-ruudhaya

In the git clone command replace the hostname with the config name given for the host in above config file
- instead of "git clone git@github.com:ruudhaya/knowledge_store.git"
- used "git clone git@ruudhaya:ruudhaya/knowledge_store.git"

Still, the commits were having the my work email and name, which has been configured in --global config
Do the following to use the personal email and name -

Once the repository is cloned, updated the user.name and user.email for this particular repository
git config user.name "udhay"
git config user.email "personalemail@gmail.com"
