Graph Data to OGM Code Generation
---------------------------------

[Neo4J Database]

Handles the Domain Model Objects and their relations better

We could use OGM - Object Graph model similar to ORM for relational databases

From the Graph data, can we get an equivalent data models?

Usage:
    We can define nodes and relations using the Cypher Query Language and create/populate the Graph database.
    Once it has been populated, to operate with the Graph database, we need to define the equivalent objects and need to work with OGM.

    Similar to creating the bootstrapping code from OpenAPI Specification, can we create similar bootstrapping implementation in any language

Plans:
- Study the OGM and its implementaions in different places (Spring Data / Neo4J Graph)
- Ability to get All the relation from a root node(s)
- Ability to get all the attributes of a node/relation
- Map them to the data annotating constructs in OGM
- Generate code using some DSL - Need more clarity, but it would have been available for similar problems
